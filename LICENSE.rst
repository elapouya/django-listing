Django-listing is licensed under the GPLv3 license for all open source applications.
You can use it for free if your application is open source and does not generate money.

A commercial license is required for all commercial applications or non-open applications,
this includes :

- Any web site with ads or to sell something,
- Any application that includes django-listing you plan to sell
- Any service that includes django-listing
- Any application that includes django-listing used inside a company
- etc...

For the moment the commercial license is free but requires you to put a link on every page a
listing is present. The link can use very small font size, but must be still readable.
The HTML code could be::

    <a href="https://github.com/elapouya/django-listing">Powered by django-listing</a>
